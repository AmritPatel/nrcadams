# The `nrcadams` R package

A R package used to pull data from NRC's ADAMS document repository.

Do you ever want to keep track of the most recent back and forth between
applicants and the NRC but you find NRC web based ADAMS searches cumbersome?
If so, this package might be for you!

# How to install `nrcadams`

This R package is based on tidyverse, so both R and tidyverse installation
is recommended. Web based ADAMS results are processed in xml, so the `xml2`
package is a prerequisite. This package is programmed using base R pipes, 
so versions of R greater than 4.1 are required. 

Please install this package using `remotes`:

```r
remotes::install_github("mrdenman-nuclear/nrcadams")
```

This package is unlikely to be published on CRAN. 

# How to use this package

The `nrcadams` package is fairly limited at this time. All of the key 
functionality runs through the `search_docket`. At least one docket number
is required, but you can filter the results by specifying how many days
in the past you want to search for as well as search terms. The function
outputs a tibble of results including URLs to the documents. 

```r
ACU_MSRR <- c(99902088, 05000610)
ACU_MSRR |>
  nrcadams::search_docket(
    days_back = 20,
    search_term = "Acceptance"
    )
```
