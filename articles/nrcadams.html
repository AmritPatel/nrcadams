</h2>
<p>One of the more confusing aspects of the NRC’s document repository is
how the NRC assigns docket numbers. During pre-application engagement,
the companies are assigned a docket number that starts with
<code>999</code>. Once the NRC accepts a companies license application
for review, the NRC will assign a docket number based upon the type of
license. For example, companies applying for a traditional two stage
license under Part 50 will have a docket number that begins with
<code>050</code>. Companies applying for a combined operating license
under Part 52 will have a docket number that begins with
<code>052</code>. Even after an applicant receives a docket number for a
given facility or design, the applicant may still submit documents to
the pre-application docket if the information would support future
licensing submittals.</p>

</h2>
<p>As an open regulator, the NRC is required to publicly provide
non-proprietary and non-export controlled information to the public.
When an applicant submits a proprietary document, the NRC will post the
non-proprietary portions of the document on ADAMS. The NRC typically
strives to ensure that enough information is in the public sphere to
justify any licensing actions.</p>
<p>To keep up-to-date with ACU’s MSRR license, it is best to search
through both the pre-application and docketed information.</p>

<p>A given docket will include email correspondence in addition to
reports and safety evaluations. Generally, letters and emails are more
noise than signal and can be filtered out of a search results. Instead
of mucking around with the ADAMS API to filter out these results, it is
simpler to use the <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html" class="external-link">dplyr::filter</a></code> to filter on the returned
results.</p>
